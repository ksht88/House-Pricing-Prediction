# House-Pricing-Prediction

**House Pricing Dataset:** The Dataset contains 506 observations of house prices across towns near Delhi. The data has been taken from various websites, and then, combined into a CSV file. Corresponding to each house price, data of 18 other variables is available on which price is suspected to depend.

As a Manager of a Real Estate Company, we have to 'predict the selling potential of the property'. Based on the historical data, we have to predict whether a property will be sold within 3 months of listing or not. From the dataset, the 'Sold' Variable is the dependent variable while others are independent variables.
