# House-Pricing-Prediction
As a Manager of a Real Estate Company, we have to 'predict the selling potential of the property'. Based on the historical data, we have to predict whether a property will be sold within 3 months of listing or not. From the dataset, the 'Sold' Variable is the dependent variable while others are independent variables.
